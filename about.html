    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project is a Rapid Fire Quiz Website prototype created for learning
      and demonstration purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project shows how quiz questionnaires and scoring systems can be
      designed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users can enter answers to questions, scores, and leaderboard information.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is built using <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, and basic
      <span>JavaScript</span>.
